# New Albany Highschool Robotics Mission:

The mission of the New Albany High School robotics team is to create an award winning robot while fostering curiosity and developing lifelong friendships. In our positive work environment we encourage learning and accept any amount of experience. We learn from each other's as well as our own mistakes and promote STEM, marketing, management, and leadership interests through our program.
